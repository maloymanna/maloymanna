      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Project Management Institute PMI&lt;/strong&gt; is the premier standards and professional organization for project management. It works in collaboration with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to develop and promote project management standards. Its certifications recognize knowledge and competency and the &lt;strong&gt;Project Management Professional (PMP&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg; &lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; certification is widely considered as the gold standard. PMI has been criticised for being slow to adapt to changes e.g. acknowledging that agile methods were being increasingly adopted in the tech industry as well as these being particularly suited to changing requirements and initiatives with uncertainties e.g. those in startups. However there&amp;rsquo;s not much generalized awareness in tech about standards beyond those related directly with tech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

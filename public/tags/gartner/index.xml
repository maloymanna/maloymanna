      <description>&lt;p&gt;With most companies listing BI within their top agenda, and with the rising costs and confusion around proving the worth of BI and justifying its costs, it makes sense to try and understand the evolution of BI adoption and maturity in organizations. Knowing what is possible with BI and knowing the challenges and pitfalls allows organizations to plan their BI strategy and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few schools of thought and available literature on the lifecycle of BI implementation and maturity in organizations, defining the models. Most are proprietary models provided by consultancies, which are primarily based on technical point of view or applies the knowledge management function to BI, following the &lt;strong&gt;Ladder of Business Intelligence (LOBI) model&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By definition Business Intelligence (&lt;strong&gt;BI&lt;/strong&gt;) has been about making decisions based on information obtained from meaningful data. At one point of time we had terms like decision support systems (&lt;strong&gt;DSS&lt;/strong&gt;) to define technology which has finally evolved into BI as we know it now. Or has it? Somewhere along the line, we became entangled in the technology aspect of it and with all the buzzwords of data warehousing, data mining, dimensional modeling, data marts, **CRM **and **SCM **it is not difficult to see why. It is only of late that the focus has moved back to the &amp;ldquo;decision making&amp;rdquo; aspect of BI rather than focusing on the technology &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile projects come with their own challenges. While the tech industry has increasingly adopted agile, practical experience about agile methods is not always available. Certain consultancies and third parties have made roaring business out of the agile coaching usually solicited by corporations while embarking on agile transformations. In many cases, the corporations did not have a system of follow-up and in others the consultants did not help adapt the frameworks to the specific case at hand. In the end, teams end up without understanding the agile values and &amp;ldquo;whys&amp;rdquo; of using agile and focus on ceremonies like the stand up meeting or having a kanban board. Along with misconceptions and lack of clarity about the methods to be worked with, these are some of the main reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve seen agile projects fail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

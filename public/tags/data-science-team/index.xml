      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, we&amp;rsquo;ve had several conversations in our data lab regarding data engineering problems and day to day problems we face with unsupervised data scientists who find it difficult to deploy their code into production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://maloymanna.github.io/post/datascience3.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Data scientist&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The opinions from business seemed to cluster around a tacit definition of data scientists as researchers, primarily from statistics or mathematics backgrounds, who are experienced in machine learning algorithms and often in some domain areas specific to our business, (e.g. actuaries in insurance), but not necessarily having skills of writing production-ready code.&#xA;The key driver behind the somewhat opposing strain of thought came from the developers and data engineers who often quoted Cloudera&amp;rsquo;s Director of Data Science - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/josh_wills&#34;&gt;Josh Wills&lt;/a&gt; - famous for his &amp;ldquo;definition of a data scientist tweet&amp;rdquo;:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SAP BI 4.0 release (codenamed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aurora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) has been the first major release of the BI platform since SAP acquired BusinessObjects. In this release, the semantic layer (universe layer for the uninitiated) has been re-worked completely to expose all business data under a single umbrella. The self-service BI portal (aka Infoview) has been revamped with a new AJAX based design and providing quicker and easier access to content. Publishing and distribution of BI content to mass audience has been made easier. There are also improvements to the lifecycle management (LCM tool) and platform administration (CMC, CCM) from a single console. This is in a nutshell are the changes that Aurora or SAP BO 4.0 bring, allowing BI content to be delivered across different channels ranging from the browser (BI Launch Pad, SharePoint, SAP NetWeaver Portal, Java Portal) to desktop (widgets), MS-Office and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SAP finally &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/about/newsroom/press.epx?pressid=13894&#34;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;on September 14, 2010 that it was getting onto the pre-packaged analytics bandwagon.  SAP announced ten applications in this first release for six industries (Consumer Products, Healthcare, Financial Services, Public Sector, Retail and Telecommunications) in its BusinessObjects  offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/solutions/sapbusinessobjects/large/eim/rapidmarts/index.epx&#34;&gt;rapid-marts&lt;/a&gt; offering that the then BOBJ used to have and leveraging SAP’s industry and line of business expertise, these new applications are based on the SAP Business Objects XI platform – WebIntelligence, Crystal Reports and Dashboards (formerly Xcelsius). Bill McDermott, the joint CEO of SAP, described it as “&lt;strong&gt;complete and ready-to-go&lt;/strong&gt;” and claimed the applications can be deployed in &lt;em&gt;as less as eight weeks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution of the BO XI platform - from XI R2 to XI 3.1 SP2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With BO XI 3.1 SP2 out in July this year, it is probably time to make a trip down the years to find out how the XI platform has evolved and matured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The timeline:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI R2 SP2 - service pack release in March 2007 with productivity pack - QaaWS and LiveOffice connectors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI 3.0 - new major release in February 2008 - the first release after SAP acquired BOBJ in October 2007&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI 3.1 - upgrade release in September 2008&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI 3.1 SP2 - service pack release on 24 July 2009 - with enhanced SAP integration&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where were we with XI R2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developing a Business Objects security model - BO XI 3.1</title>
      <link>https://maloymanna.github.io/2009/08/28/developing-a-business-objects-security-model-bo-xi-3-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While developing a Business Objects security model, you need to focus on the different types of security:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Security&lt;/strong&gt; - this would govern access to specific application features, e.g. editing reports, drilling down, ability to schedule reports etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Security&lt;/strong&gt; - this governs access to specific data - rows or columns or cells as per authorization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure Security&lt;/strong&gt; - governs physical and electronic access to systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure security is the first to be designed. This typically happens when the architecture is being drawn up. It is important to get as much early visibility into the various ways the system is likely to be used, not only in the present but also in the foreseeable future, so that adjustments and capacity for future planning can be done to the extent possible. This also helps in deciding on the type of data security that would be required initially, though this can change over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BusinessObjects universe design best practices</title>
      <link>https://maloymanna.github.io/2009/07/19/businessobjects-universe-design-best-practices/</link>

      <guid>https://maloymanna.github.io/2009/07/19/businessobjects-universe-design-best-practices/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having relocated from the Silicon Valley to Bangalore a year back, I’m now working in an MIS – strategic reporting role. In my role to evangelize the use of BI best practices and tools, one of the foremost is that of universe design.  As a matter of fact, I’m currently being involved in formalizing a BI policy around the tools we use most – Oracle, Informatica and SAP Business Objects (along with migration from our legacy BO to the XI platform!) – so a lot of my current work is related to best practices, design guidelines and preparing unit test checklists for my team of developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SAP drops Business Objects Performance Management</title>
      <link>https://maloymanna.github.io/2008/03/29/sap-drops-business-objects-performance-management/</link>

      <guid>https://maloymanna.github.io/2008/03/29/sap-drops-business-objects-performance-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In what seems to be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/28/SAP-retires-overlapping-BI-products_1.html&#34;&gt;speedy decision&lt;/a&gt; to clean up an overlapping product line, following its acquisition of Business Objects (&lt;a href=&#34;http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ABOBJ&#34;&gt;BOBJ&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;http://sap.com&#34;&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt; has decided to retire the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessobjects.com/product/epm/&#34;&gt;Business Objects Performance Management&lt;/a&gt; product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking its place would be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/demos/demplayv2/demoPlayMaster.html?demos/Strategy_Management_US/Strategy_Management_US_config.xml&#34;&gt;SAP Strategy Management&lt;/a&gt; (a product &lt;a href=&#34;http://biguru.wordpress.com/about/&#34;&gt;biguru&lt;/a&gt; is SAP certified). &lt;strong&gt;SAP Strategy Management&lt;/strong&gt; is the new name for what used to be Pilot Software&amp;rsquo;s flagship product &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/usa/company/press/pilotsoftware/index.epx&#34;&gt;PilotWorks&lt;/a&gt; product, which SAP acquired in February 2007. No doubt about the fact that PilotWorks Server which is based on a powerful OLAP engine, and has an extremely user-friendly GUI on top of it, is a few notches above the clunky Performance Manager of &lt;a href=&#34;http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ABOBJ&#34;&gt;BOBJ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business Objects has just released the updated &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessobjects.com/product/catalog/xcelsius/default.asp&#34;&gt;Xcelsius 2008&lt;/a&gt; after a long &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessobjects.com/campaigns/xcelsius/contest/&#34;&gt;beta program&lt;/a&gt;. What are the top new features of this exciting data visualization and dashboard tool? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out the top 10:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy-Paste&lt;/strong&gt;- Productivity is bound to increase through collaborative development now as it is possible to copy-paste components between XLF files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filtered Rows&lt;/strong&gt; - Selector components like List box and combo-box now include a new option in the insert-options list. This is the &amp;ldquo;Filtered rows&amp;rdquo; option, automatically removing duplicates. In the previous version, this worked only with the Filter component.t&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SaaS BI - Software as a service model in Business Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://maloymanna.github.io/2008/03/14/saas-bi-software-as-a-service-model-in-business-intelligence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2008 04:29:16 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SaaS has taken off in a big way in the past few years. And BI has not been lagging behind. For leading vendors like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessobjects.com/&#34;&gt;BOBJ&lt;/a&gt; (an SAP company) or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cognos.com/&#34;&gt;Cognos&lt;/a&gt; (an IBM company), it&amp;rsquo;s going to be close to 2 years now since they started their SaaS BI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What exactly are the advantages of SaaS over the traditional approach?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Benefits are aplenty, from zero costs of purchasing hardware, hiring of key IT personnel like system administrators and DBAs, to minimal implementation and maintenance costs. With CRM being made affordable to SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salesforce.com&#34;&gt;salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt; (note the huge success of its &lt;strong&gt;AppExchange&lt;/strong&gt;), and the fact that large enterprise adoption of BI was complete, meant that the only scope for future growth in BI would come from upgrades of platforms (analogous to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Windows operating system - think of BOBJ upgrading from 6.5 to XI) or from expansion in the SME space with better offerings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Acquisitions in BI - End of the best of breed?</title>
      <link>https://maloymanna.github.io/2007/12/20/acquisitions-in-bi-end-of-the-best-of-breed/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time I talked about the trends in the BI space. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into one of those trends - M&amp;amp;As and how it is shaping BI as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2007/tc20071112_678294.htm&#34;&gt;BusinessWeek article&lt;/a&gt; claimed the end of the &lt;strong&gt;best-of-breed&lt;/strong&gt; approach to BI with the demise of the major pure-play BI vendors like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessobjects.com&#34;&gt;BOBJ&lt;/a&gt; now owned by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com&#34;&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a friendly takeover or Hyperion acquired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com&#34;&gt;Oracle &lt;/a&gt;or the latest - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibm.com&#34;&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cognos.com&#34;&gt;Cognos&lt;/a&gt;. While it is true that some of the major players have been acquired by the bigger businesses, there is no reason as to why the mid-size companies should go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

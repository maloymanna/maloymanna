      <description>&lt;p&gt;By definition Business Intelligence (&lt;strong&gt;BI&lt;/strong&gt;) has been about making decisions based on information obtained from meaningful data. At one point of time we had terms like decision support systems (&lt;strong&gt;DSS&lt;/strong&gt;) to define technology which has finally evolved into BI as we know it now. Or has it? Somewhere along the line, we became entangled in the technology aspect of it and with all the buzzwords of data warehousing, data mining, dimensional modeling, data marts, **CRM **and **SCM **it is not difficult to see why. It is only of late that the focus has moved back to the &amp;ldquo;decision making&amp;rdquo; aspect of BI rather than focusing on the technology &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

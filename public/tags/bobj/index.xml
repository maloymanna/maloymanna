      <description>&lt;p&gt;SAP BI 4.0 release (codenamed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aurora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) has been the first major release of the BI platform since SAP acquired BusinessObjects. In this release, the semantic layer (universe layer for the uninitiated) has been re-worked completely to expose all business data under a single umbrella. The self-service BI portal (aka Infoview) has been revamped with a new AJAX based design and providing quicker and easier access to content. Publishing and distribution of BI content to mass audience has been made easier. There are also improvements to the lifecycle management (LCM tool) and platform administration (CMC, CCM) from a single console. This is in a nutshell are the changes that Aurora or SAP BO 4.0 bring, allowing BI content to be delivered across different channels ranging from the browser (BI Launch Pad, SharePoint, SAP NetWeaver Portal, Java Portal) to desktop (widgets), MS-Office and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SAP finally &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/about/newsroom/press.epx?pressid=13894&#34;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;on September 14, 2010 that it was getting onto the pre-packaged analytics bandwagon.  SAP announced ten applications in this first release for six industries (Consumer Products, Healthcare, Financial Services, Public Sector, Retail and Telecommunications) in its BusinessObjects  offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/solutions/sapbusinessobjects/large/eim/rapidmarts/index.epx&#34;&gt;rapid-marts&lt;/a&gt; offering that the then BOBJ used to have and leveraging SAP’s industry and line of business expertise, these new applications are based on the SAP Business Objects XI platform – WebIntelligence, Crystal Reports and Dashboards (formerly Xcelsius). Bill McDermott, the joint CEO of SAP, described it as “&lt;strong&gt;complete and ready-to-go&lt;/strong&gt;” and claimed the applications can be deployed in &lt;em&gt;as less as eight weeks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With BO XI 3.1 SP2 out in July this year, it is probably time to make a trip down the years to find out how the XI platform has evolved and matured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The timeline:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI R2 SP2 - service pack release in March 2007 with productivity pack - QaaWS and LiveOffice connectors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI 3.0 - new major release in February 2008 - the first release after SAP acquired BOBJ in October 2007&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI 3.1 - upgrade release in September 2008&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XI 3.1 SP2 - service pack release on 24 July 2009 - with enhanced SAP integration&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where were we with XI R2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developing a Business Objects security model - BO XI 3.1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While developing a Business Objects security model, you need to focus on the different types of security:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Security&lt;/strong&gt; - this would govern access to specific application features, e.g. editing reports, drilling down, ability to schedule reports etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Security&lt;/strong&gt; - this governs access to specific data - rows or columns or cells as per authorization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure Security&lt;/strong&gt; - governs physical and electronic access to systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure security is the first to be designed. This typically happens when the architecture is being drawn up. It is important to get as much early visibility into the various ways the system is likely to be used, not only in the present but also in the foreseeable future, so that adjustments and capacity for future planning can be done to the extent possible. This also helps in deciding on the type of data security that would be required initially, though this can change over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Change the location Google Desktop Search indexes your data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Desktop search has become an important component of our everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the amount of &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gardner/?p=3091&#34;&gt;information explosion&lt;/a&gt;, it is only natural that users and enterprises move towards enabling desktop (and enterprise) search for users – subject of course to appropriate security and access controls. BI vendors have moved into this new business space that has opened up and seems to be one of the most promising. While Business Objects had announced support for the Google Search appliance and Google Desktop &lt;a href=&#34;http://www1.sap.com/about/newsroom/businessobjects/20060515_006446.epx&#34;&gt;back in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, their most important announcement lately has been the launch of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www1.sap.com/solutions/sapbusinessobjects/large/intelligenceplatform/bi/search-navigation/explorer/explorer-non-accelerated/index.epx&#34;&gt;Business Objects Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Polestar) product. More about that in a later post…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

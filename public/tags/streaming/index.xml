      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last few years has seen a massive change in the data landscape. With the rise of big data, there&amp;rsquo;s been rapid innovation in the tools, skills and roles working on data systems. Data architectures have evolved beyond monolithic, centralized databases and unwieldy analytic applications to distributed, scalable architectures with simpler collaborative and interactive analytic tools. In this post, I look at the defining features of modern data architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern data architectures generally feature the following (though not all of these may be present in the same system):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Kafka has become the most exciting new addition in the big data distributed architecture. Originally developed at LinkedIn, its founders Jay Kreps, Jun Rao and Neha Narkhede have launched a company Confluent to develop its open-core business model. The software at its core, Apache Kafka reinvents the database log to provide a highly scalable and fault tolerant, high performance distributed system, which serves as the data pipeline backbone for stream data processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

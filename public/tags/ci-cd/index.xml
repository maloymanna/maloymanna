      <description>&lt;p&gt;DevOps is the new buzzword for IT.  It arose out of the need to resolve issues with delivery of software as development processes adopted agile approaches. But what exactly is DevOps?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DevOps is a philosophy which advocates close collaboration between development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops) with a goal of delivering value to the end-user with improved agility and quality.  Historically developers and IT operations were separated in their own silos.  While development focused on getting features out quickly, the IT operations team were focused on maintaining the stability and performance of the systems. With little visibility into each others&amp;rsquo; work and conflicting / opposing priorities, there was little alignment on the context and the ultimate value provided to business. In the DevOps culture, there is increased collaboration and feedback, reduced silos and shared responsibility which improves outcomes. In essence, DevOps is the extension of agile values beyong development to IT Operations and collaborating together. Thus the portmanteau word: &lt;strong&gt;Dev&lt;/strong&gt;elopment + IT &lt;strong&gt;Op&lt;/strong&gt;eration&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

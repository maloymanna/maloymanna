      <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.btmarch.com/btsummit/&#34;&gt;Business Technology Summit in Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; last week – 3rd and 4th November. There were 3 tracks on cloud computing, Service Oriented Architecture and Business Intelligence, and I chose a mix of sessions across each.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;**Overall impression:**The BT Summit was heavily focused on cloud computing with half of second day having a deep dive into Amazon’s EC2 cloud offering, and several keynotes. SOA and web services, REST and similar architectural sessions were interspersed but definitely not a first-class citizen. BI came a poor third with a poor choice of sessions, and more of a rehash of what is out there for everyone, rather than something on the cutting-edge including use of appliances and columnar databases, as also in-memory databases and use of Flash and AJAX for interactive BI front-ends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

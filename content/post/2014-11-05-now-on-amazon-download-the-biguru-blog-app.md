Once you've downloaded and installed it (your smartphone Anti-Virus should scan the app after installation) by accepting the defaults, you're free to get updates on new posts from this blog!

The app is powered by the [Como App Maker](http://www.como.com) - which makes it simple to create HTML5 apps for all types of smartphones.

Enjoy your app!

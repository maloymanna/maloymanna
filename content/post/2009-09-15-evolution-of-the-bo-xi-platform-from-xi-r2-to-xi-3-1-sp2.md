With BO XI 3.1 SP2 out in July this year, it is probably time to make a trip down the years to find out how the XI platform has evolved and matured.

**The timeline:**


  * XI R2 SP2 - service pack release in March 2007 with productivity pack - QaaWS and LiveOffice connectors
  * XI 3.0 - new major release in February 2008 - the first release after SAP acquired BOBJ in October 2007
  * XI 3.1 - upgrade release in September 2008
  * XI 3.1 SP2 - service pack release on 24 July 2009 - with enhanced SAP integration

**Where were we with XI R2:**


  * Change to Crystal service-oriented platform (Crystal 10 architecture)
  * Ability to plug Crystal Reports, Web Intelligence, Desktop Intelligence, OLAP Intelligence, Dashboard Manager, Performance Manager directly into the framework
  * Single repository, security, system management, publishing, portal
  * Infoview (Replaced old BO Infoview and Crystal ePortfolio)
  * Central Management Console (CMC)
  * Import Wizard (upgrades from BO 5, 6, XI, Crystal 8.5, 9, 10)
  * Desktop Intelligence (new name for BO full client + ability to query and display Unicode data)
  * Publishing, Encyclopedia, Discussions, OLAP Intelligence, Performance Management
  * Changes to Data Integrator, Composer, Metadata Manager

  * Server Intelligence Agent (SIA) - handles service dependencies
  * Server Intelligence in CMC – clone server deployments
  * Repository Federation – replicate repository on other BO cluster

  * Data change tracking in Web Intelligence
  * Designer – “Database delegated” projection on measures
  * Universe based on stored procedures

  * Personal data provider – combine data from Excel, text, csv and get into a single report
  * Smart cubes – support for non-additive measures (percentages, ratios) and RDBMS analytical functions
  * Multi language support – dimensions, measures, prompts automatically localized to report viewer’s language
  * Native Web Intelligence printing (without PDF)
  * Enbed image in Web Intelligence report
  * Hyperlinks dialog box makes links easy to create – syntax generated by WebIntelligence (remember opendocument()?)


**What's new in XI 3.1**


  * Support for multi-forest Active Directory authentication
  * IP v6 support
  * Lifecycle Management Tool (LCMBIAR files, replace Import Wizard)
  * Saving Web Intelligence documents as CSV (data-only files) – new sheets for every 65K rows of data

  * New SDKs - [WebI Calculation Extension Points, Custom Data Provider plugin, Interactive viewing extension and integration points](https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/15320)
  * New universe SQL parameter SMART_AGGREGATE allows using most detailed aggregate tables
  *  `@Prompt` editor in universe Designer

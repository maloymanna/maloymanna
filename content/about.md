Hi, I'm Maloy. :)

I'm a data hacker. I'm also a project manager. I work at the confluence of data science, analytics, IT engineering and project management.

I love data. I believe data technologies can help us make a better world. I also see how not having the right knowledge of lean, engineering and project management causes us to miss these opportunities.

At my work, I try to realize the potential of the opportunities of data and lean principles with the discipline of engineering and project management.

I'm encouraged by the increased general awareness of the importance of data and the benefits of analytics. I hope we build a better world which respects privacy and also makes the best of the opportunities that advances in data and analytics technology offers us.

I've been a data specialist for many years. I have been involved in several Business Intelligence and data warehousing implementations. This blog is the outcome of experiences in implementations and continuous learning in the field of data.

I dabble with several tools -Powerpoints mostly :-) but also Excel, R and SQL along with trying to learn other skills. I work in big data analytics engineering  in my current job in Paris. I still find learning new analytics tools easier than French! Je ne sais pas pourquoi! ;-)
